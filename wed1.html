                    <p>When we first meet I never belived this day would come. Erica and I met when we where just in high school. What started as a friendship quickly blossomed into something more, and over the years, we’ve shared countless memories, laughs, and milestones together. Now, 5 years later, we are thrilled to be taking this next step in our journey as we exchange vows and begin the next chapter of our lives as husband and wife.
                        
                    <p>We both look forward to celebrating this special occasion surrounded by our dearest family and friends. Your presence will make our day even more meaningful and unforgettable.</p>

                <p> In Genesis, marriage is described as a profound union where two individuals, a man and a woman, are no longer separate but become one in body, heart, and soul. It symbolizes a new beginning, where the husband and wife leave their individual families to create a new, unified household. The phrase “one flesh” speaks not only to the physical aspect of marriage but also to the deep emotional, spiritual, and personal bond that defines a marital relationship.<p>
                <blockquote>
                     “What God has joined together, let no one separate”- <cite> Jesus</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Marriage, in this biblical context, is more than just a social contract or an emotional commitment. It is a divine institution designed for companionship, love, support, and the building of family. This unity fosters an environment where love and faith can flourish, and where both partners can grow together, supporting each other through life's joys and challenges</p>
                <p>Erica and I are getting married because we believe in this kind of unity—one that is deeply rooted in love, commitment, and the desire to build a life together. Just as described in Genesis, our journey together began years ago, and over time, we've come to realize that we are stronger, happier, and more complete when we are united as one.

                    Our decision to get married is a reflection of our desire to build a life together that honors this sacred union. By taking this step, we are choosing to leave behind our individual paths and fully commit to a future as one—building a home, a family, and a foundation that is grounded in love, faith, and mutual support.
                    
                    Just as the verse encourages, we are ready to "leave and cleave," to unite as one, and to walk together in faith and love for the rest of our lives. This marriage is not just about us, but about honoring the divine purpose of marriage, as laid out in Genesis 2:24.</p>
